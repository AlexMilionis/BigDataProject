# BigDataAssignment
This repository contains the coursework for the Big Data Management module, completed by Alexios Milionis and Panagiotis Chronopoulos.

This project utilized Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to manage and analyze large-scale datasets. The primary focus was on processing crime data from Los Angeles, leveraging technologies such as Apache Spark for distributed data processing, and HDFS for distributed storage. Data was stored in the Parquet format for efficient storage and faster query performance due to its columnar storage and built-in compression. Spark's Catalyst Optimizer was used to enhance query execution performance. Throughout the project, Spark DataFrames, RDDs, and Spark SQL were employed for various data processing and analysis tasks.
